#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
# i.  Defines a function called doubleL and accepts one argument. Creates an empty list called 'res'
#     then loops from 0 to 'n', but excludes 'n'. for every integer until n, it multiplies it by 2
#     and adds it to the 'res' list. It does this until it reaches the number before 'n'. it then returns 
#     the list. Then we enter another for loop which also calls doubleL(n) and passes 5 as an argument. This 
#     means that it loops thorugh every element in the list that is returned by the function. It then prints
#     the element in the list and also adds ' : ' after it prints the element. This acts as a way to seperate 
#     each element in the list. 

 #Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

# i. FIrst, the code in the square brackets creates a list with the values of 0 - 4. It then loops over each 
#    each element, 'n', and multiplies each element by 2. After that, the code then loops over the list and 
#    for every element, 'x', it prints the element and adds ' : ' at the end to seperate each element. 
    
#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')

# i. First, a generator function named 'doubleG' is defined and accepts a single argument 'n'. 
#    The function loops from 0 to 'n' but excludes 'n' and for each number, it is multiplied by 
#    2. This temporarily suspends the function's execution and allows it to yield values one at
#    a time. A for loop is created and loops through the the generator that is returned by
#    doubleG. for every generator that is returned, it prints the generator and a ' : ' to seperate 
#    each generator. 
    
# ii. doubleG(n) is a generator funciton. This is because it uses the yield keyword which returns 
#     a generator object. Yield allows you to generate values one at a time. This reduces memory usage 
#     since the values that are being read are not stored in a dataset.
